# Miles to Kilometer Converter Project

This Python application utilizes the `tkinter` library to create a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to convert miles to kilometers.
The application takes user input in miles and displays the equivalent distance in kilometers when the user clicks the "Calculate" button.

## Key Features

**Graphical User Interface with Tkinter:**
  - The application uses the `tkinter` library to create a simple and intuitive user interface for the conversion tool.

**Input Field for Miles:**
  - Users can input the distance in miles using an entry field. The application initializes the field with a default value of 0.

**Conversion Logic:**
  - The application includes a function that converts the input miles to kilometers using the conversion factor (1 mile = 1.609 kilometers) and updates the displayed result.

**Labels for Displaying Information:**
  - The application uses labels to provide context for the input and output, including labels for miles, kilometers and the conversion result.
